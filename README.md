A university project I worked on to create an AI chatbot with a convolutional nerual network but with more tweaks and clean-ups to take it from a quick university assignment to a piece ready for my portfolio. The chatbot was written in Python with rule-based and similarity-based components, extended into deep image classification, simple logical knowledge-base component and finally cloud-based multilingual component.
